- 2021/01/23: [Dear all. I would like to thank all the MeiliSearch developers, it seems like a good product.

- 2021/02/25: [The scout integration is what gets me. The algolia pricing model just seems like recipe for disaster, but having scout support for search seems so nice.

- 2021/03/15: [the best way i can think to describe elasticsearch is like cursed enterprise shenanigans that somehow omits any of the fun parts of shenanigans and just makes you stressed and/or sad, so much so that i nearly paid someone else to run it for me before i found @meilisearch](https://twitter.com/thejsa_/status/1371562357525217281)
