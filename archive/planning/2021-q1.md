# 2021 Q1

## Planning
This is an exhaustive list of the main tasks we will accomplish in the first quarter of 2021 to move closer to our yearly goals. Estimates are made by half a day incrementation.

We planned our first quarter based on the information we have gathered. Since it’s our first planning together, we have no velocity data. We define the goals-oriented tasks for about 50% of our respective time; the other half is for our daily focus and time-based opportunities: answering Slack questions, meetings, reviewing documentation PRs…

Since the planning is in the process of being finalized during the second week of January, it means that we have 10 weeks left: therefore, we have 40 work days remaining in Q1, which gives us about 20 days of work per person at half capacity. We should see around 60 days on time estimated for Q1.

You can follow the ETA of our Q1 planning within the [Developer Relations Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/meilisearch/projects/8). All tasks point to a specific issue with more details, if needed.

## Retrospective

At the end of Q1, we took the time to reflect on the last three months. Here are the main topics of our discussion on the form of **O**bservations and possible **S**olutions on how to improve those points in Q2.

**O:** We overestimated our team velocity and underestimated our day-to-day tasks (i.e.: Slack community, documentation PRs...) which results in failure to reach many of our Q1 goals. Our planning process was also too detailed for a startup at our stage.
**S:** We are a new team, in a new company, so it was to be expected. We will focus on three main tasks per team member that must be achieved in the next quarter, and two tasks to tackle if the time permit.

**O:** We often felt overwhelmed with everything we have to do to reach our goals, and to help the company move forward.
**S:** It is a feeling we may have to live with for at least another quarter or two, until we have a stronger foundation and better processes when it comes to Developer Relations at Meilisearch. We need to move from being in reaction mode to being more intentional with our time. One thing that will help is to better prioritize. To do so we will work with different prioritization levels for our tasks and focus only on the most important first. We will continue to use GitHub issues as a way to make a brain dump on things we need to do, even if they do not require immediate actions: things writing down freed some brain space. One additional problem is that we don't always consider everything else we do as accomplishment or "our work", meetings being a good example. It is a mindset to make ours.

**O:** We don't always feel like we achieved a lot during a work day or week.
**S:** This is mostly a personal matter, but we discussed solutions that can be done individually like writing down everything we do with tools like [jrnl](https://github.com/jrnl-org/jrnl) or using pomodoro to have a better perspective on how we used our time. We also need to take on best practices like atomic commits when we do PRs: it's easier for everyone involved (coding & reviewing) and help with some dopamine boosts.
