# Excerpt & metadata guidelines

This document summarizes the SEO best practices for excerpts and meta descriptions.

## Definition & purpose

The excerpt and the meta description summarizes a post's content.

Excerpts will show at the top of the post, and on the blog index page. Ideally, your excerpt should flow into your first paragraph nicely.

Meta descriptions will be displayed in the search results of web search engines. Itâ€™s one of the first things people will likely see when searching for something.

Because they serve the same purpose, the text of both can be the same and follow the same guidelines.


## Best practices
- **Keep it under 155 characters**: it shouldn't take more than 2 or 3 lines in the blog's index page. Also, longer descriptions will be truncated in search results
- **Use an active voice**: it's more readable and engaging
- **Make it unique**: create descriptions that accurately describe the specific post
- **Use your main keyword**: if the search keyword matches a part of the description, Google will highlight it in the search results.
