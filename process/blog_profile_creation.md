# Blog profile creation

## Context
Ghost, our blogging platform, and our current blog theme automatically create pages for authors, and display author profile pictures on the blog post page and the homepage.
Every blog author has to fill in their description. Our audience will have a better idea of who the folks working at Meilisear are. We don't want to be another corporation with random workers.

## Process
- Before publishing an article, you need access to Ghost.
  - Meilisearch workers: ask someone from the DevRel team to create credentials for you.
  - External contributors: discuss this with your contact at Meilisearch.
- After signing in, fill your description at https://meilisearch.ghost.io/ghost/#/settings/staff/{USER_SLUG}

If you don't feel inspired, keep it simple: "I work on the core team at MeiliSearch".

All details are optional. For instance, when filling the location, you can be very specific, go for the country you usually live in, or not say anything at all.
