## Planning Processes
Once the yearly goals are defined for our team (need to add the process for that), we need to each quarter. We decided as a company to plan one quarter in detail at the time, which means that for January 1st, only Q1 plan is detailed. To ensure a healthy and participative team culture, our director decided to make planning a team exercise: with some initial guidance based on the team's vision and company culture, we defined our different goals and how we will measure the team together.

### 3 Weeks Prior
Even if the quarter is not done yet, we should have a pretty good idea on how it went, and what we will achieve by the end. We schedule a one-hour meeting for a team retrospective about the last quarter. Each team member prepared themselves by reflecting on the last three months:
- What did we do that were successful, that we are proud of?
- Is there anything we should stop doing or change to make us more efficient, effective and happy?
- Did we plan our tasks correctly? If not, what changed?
- Are our estimation close enough? If not, how can we better estimate our team's velocity?
- Anything else that is worth discussing that will move the team in two important directions:
  1. deliver better quality impactful results;
  2. grow the team happiness level.

Nothing is insignificant. Everything that can improve those points are worth discussing. There is nothing stupid, as long as it's constructive. If there is a sensitive topic you would prefer not to share in a team setting, please discuss with [@fharper](https://github.com/fharper) directly prior to this meeting. This is **not** a meeting for pointing fingers: if there is a productivity challenge with one or more of your coworkers, [@fharper](https://github.com/fharper) will handle those with the individuals directly.

After the discussions, [@fharper](https://github.com/fharper) will add a summary of the discussions in the `planning/YYYY-Q#.md` file.

Before next week, [@fharper](https://github.com/fharper) will share with the team his vision for what should be prioritized, if any, during the next quarter so all members will have this information to help them prepare for the meeting the week after.

To ensure the process takes as less time as possible, our issues in the repositories we own should **always** be up to date.

### 2 Weeks Prior
We schedule a one-hour meeting for a team brainstorming about the next quarter:
- based on the data from last quarters, what is our team velocity?
- what should be prioritized the next quarter and why?

For this exercise, each team member should think about the big picture for their role in the next three months: we will discuss them as a group.

Based on the meeting discussion, each member will add to the planning document the tasks they think they should focus on for the next quarter. **Each** task we want to do should be created as an issue in the [documentation repository](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation) for anything documentation related and in the [devrel repository](https://github.com/meilisearch/devrel) for anything else.

### 1 Week Prior

We schedule a one-hour meeting to review, as a team, the planning document for the next quarter. It ensures that our tasks aligned and that we donâ€™t forget anything. After the meeting, [@fharper](https://github.com/fharper) will add the information in the `planning/YYYY-Q#.md` file.

To ensure we have the proper history of our achievement, and being able to share our success with the company during the last follow-up (company-wide biweekly meeting) of the quarter, [@fharper](https://github.com/fharper) list our team's achievement for the actual quarter in the `planning/YYYY-Q#.md` file.

ðŸŽ‰  Lastly, for all the hard work we have done, we will celebrate with a team activity. Our celebration activity will be decided as a team: [@fharper](https://github.com/fharper) will need some propositions: the sooner, the better since it may require a reservation and some preparation. You can add your suggestions in the proper issue created at the beginning of the quarter.
