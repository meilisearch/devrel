## MeiliSearch Goals
This is a summary our MeiliSearch company goals for 2021 and how we can influence those.

### Community
This is where we can have a real & huge impact: in the end, community is basically developer relations, with the help of every other part of the business.

#### Contributor management
1. Better contributor onboarding
2. Contributions outside of just code
3. MeiliSearch advocates program (ex.: Microsoft MVP, Google Experts)

#### Feedback process
1. Structured feedback loop
2. Feedback quality & quantity

#### Measure satisfaction
1. Measuring MeiliSearch impact on developers

#### Growing community
1. Growing the community
2. Community engagement & longevity
3. Consider all levels of expertise & experience

### Product
We won’t participate in building new features or fixing issues directly on the product or integration repositories, but we can influence the roadmap with the feedback we get from being on the ground with our community members.

### Monetization
Even though increasing the size of our community increases our chances of getting paid customers, we still won’t directly impact this 2021 goal. In addition to influencing the product roadmap, we need to ensure that we don’t alienate our open-source community while communicating about monetization. This is critical!

## OKRs

Most of our 2021 goals aren’t quantifiable: we do it or don’t do it, there is no in-between. The OKRs (Objective Key Results) are listed in company goals order, Developer Relations Framework first (a devrel only goal) as it is the foundation on which we can achieve the rest. MeiliSearch goals for this year are mostly oriented toward our community, hence the nearly perfect alignment with ours.

## Q1 planning
This is an exhaustive list of the main tasks we will accomplish in the first quarter of 2021 to move closer to our yearly goals. Estimates are made by half a day incrementation.

We planned our first quarter based on the information we have gathered. Since it’s our first planning together, we have no velocity data. We define the goals-oriented tasks for about 50% of our respective time; the other half is for our daily focus and time-based opportunities: answering Slack questions, meetings, reviewing documentation PRs…

Since the planning is in the process of being finalized during the second week of January, it means that we have 10 weeks left: therefore, we have 40 work days remaining in Q1, which gives us about 20 days of work per person at half capacity. We should see around 60 days on time estimated for Q1.

You can follow the ETA of our Q1 planning within the [Developer Relations Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/meilisearch/projects/8). All tasks point to a specific issue with more details, if needed.
