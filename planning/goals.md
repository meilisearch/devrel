# 2021 Goals

## MeiliSearch Goals
This is a summary our MeiliSearch company goals for 2021 and how we can influence those.

### Community
This is where we can have a real & huge impact: in the end, community is basically developer relations, with the help of every other part of the business.

#### Contributor management
1. Better contributor onboarding
2. Contributions outside of just code
3. MeiliSearch advocates program (ex.: Microsoft MVP, Google Experts)

#### Feedback process
1. Structured feedback loop
2. Feedback quality & quantity

#### Measure satisfaction
1. Measuring MeiliSearch impact on developers

#### Growing community
1. Growing the community
2. Community engagement & longevity
3. Consider all levels of expertise & experience

### Product
We won’t participate in building new features or fixing issues directly on the product or integration repositories, but we can influence the roadmap with the feedback we get from being on the ground with our community members.

### Monetization
Even though increasing the size of our community increases our chances of getting paid customers, we still won’t directly impact this 2021 goal. In addition to influencing the product roadmap, we need to ensure that we don’t alienate our open-source community while communicating about monetization. This is critical!
