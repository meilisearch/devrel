# Developer Relations at MeiliSearch

We will slowly add all our processes in this repo. This is how we roll at MeiliSearch, open source to the core! You can also have an idea of what the developer relations team is working on by checking the [devrel issues](https://github.com/meilisearch/devrel/issues) (for devrel tasks only).

## Our Mission

We help developers be successful by nurturing a healthy and open-source community around MeiliSearch. This means listening to, inspiring, educating, and supporting our community however we can.
