# URL guidelines

This document summarizes the SEO best practices for URLs.

ðŸ‘‰ The URL should state clearly what is on the page.

## DOs

- Keep it simple and descriptive
- Readable
- Include [keywords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_term)
- Short: around 3 to 5 words

## DON'Ts

- Avoid using a year: to easily update the content and keep the ranking the page has earned
- Avoid having similar URLs slugs: search engine crawlers might think there's content duplication
- Don't use non-ASCII characters like emojis
