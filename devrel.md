## The 3Cs
The three pillars of Developer Relations are **C**ommunity, **C**ontent, and **C**ode, also known as the 3Cs*. The main focus of our team is the community: just read our mission to understand that everything we do is for our community. To help us achieve our mission, we use two main activities: content and code. The former is any type of content on any useful medium; some examples are talks at conferences, documentation, or video tutorials. The latter, code, is part of the foundation of who we are: we are developers. It translates into code examples for the documentation, code demos for our conference presentations, technical support, or even being responsible for specific APIs or contributing to open source to give back to the community and be a good web citizen. All together, they form the foundation of developer relations.

## Lean Approach
We believe that plans should never be set in stone: they are a lighthouse guiding us in the right direction. We make plans to ensure that we are focusing in the right direction and maximizing our efforts where we can have the greatest impact.

Our process will always be “[lean startup](http://theleanstartup.com/principles)” style.

We will update our yearly planning and tasks based on the KPI we will gather while working on them. If we are not successful, even with all the focus work done, we will take the time to evaluate our processes. We can go as far as modifying the yearly goal to adapt to how our industry and community is responding to our efforts.

## Priority System
We are using a priority system for our tasks and goals based on the [MoSCoW method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method).

P0 - Urgent
P1 - Must have
P2 - Should have
P3 - Could have
P4 - Will not have

### P0 - Urgent
Priority P0 is for urgent things needed on our team or another team needing our help. They are the reactive mode tasks. In a perfect world, those would-be situations created by external factors as we should plan better on our side.

### P1 - Must Have
Priority P1 is for non-negotiable tasks that will help us achieve our goals with the maximum impact. Those are the tasks, when planned for a quarter, should be done by the next one.

### P2 - Should Have
Priority P2 is for important initiatives that may not bring as much value to the team than the P1. It includes things we should do that won’t directly help us achieve our goals, but needed to move in the right direction. A P2 can become P1 when they are critical for the business or are prerequisites for another P1 (i.e.: changing the documentation framework—we need it to manage different versions of MeiliSearch after v1, but it has no direct impact on our goals).

### P3 - Could have
Priority P3 is for nice to have initiatives: they have a small impact, and are mostly done when we have the time.

### P4 - Will not have
Priority P4 have a misleading title: will not have is mostly about our team. They are the tasks or initiatives that are not a priority and don’t bring much value, still they could be nice. If they are really short to do, it could be a task we do to change our mind between more important ones, but in most cases, they are tasks open for anyone else to take.
